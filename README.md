# Info for Fall 23 prospective PhD students

This repo contains info and FAQs for prospective PhD students of [Chris Donahue](https://chrisdonahue.com)'s yet-to-be-named lab in the Computer Science Department at CMU.

## About my lab

My lab will generally work at the intersection of **ML, music, multimedia, and creativity** (notable venues include **ISMIR, ICLR, ICML, NeurIPS, ICASSP, and CHI**). At a high-level, my research involves (1) **improving ML methods for generative modeling** of music and other multimedia, and (2) **building real-world interactive systems** which allow a broad audience to harness the creative potential of generative models. A concrete example is my [Piano Genie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRb0XAnUpIk) system which uses generative models to allow non-musicians a glimpse of musical improvisation. Please **see my recent [research statement](https://github.com/chrisdonahue/fall23-phd-prospectives/raw/main/Research%20Statement.pdf)*** for a more thorough overview.

*Since I wrote this research statement one year ago, I have been fascinated by the ongoing "renaissance" in generative modeling for creativity—notably in the text-to-image space through models like DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion, but surely for many other forms of multimedia in the near future. I would also be excited to foster a lab that can be part of this conversation, both from a technical and sociotechnical perspective.

## FAQs

### How do I apply?

**Apply via the main [CMU School of Computer Science PhD application](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/academics/graduate-admissions) by December 12th!**. Additional [instructions](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/academics/application_instructions) and [FAQs](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/academics/faq).

At CMU, the School of Computer Science (SCS) has many departments, one of which is (confusingly) named the Computer Science Department (CSD). I am affiliated w/ CSD, so **make sure to apply to CSD via the "Ph.D. in Computer Science"** option to ensure your application will be routed properly:

You should also specify that you want to work with me directly. Because I don't formally start until next fall, I am currently not listed on the list for specifying faculty of interest, though I am working on getting added (please check back). For now, please specify "Machine Learning" / "Other" for this section, and **mention my name verbatim in your statement of purpose**.

### What kind of students am I looking for?

I am most directly looking for students w/ a technical background in ML, computer science, or engineering, as well as a background in some creative domain of interest and a desire to explore the use of ML in that domain. Ideally, you may already have some research experience or even publications. But these are very loose requirements and I am easily intrigued by passionate people from interesting backgrounds—please apply if you have any interest regardless of your background!

Note that CSD admits students to the _department_ rather than to _individual labs_. Hence, I can weigh in on admissions, but the final decisions are up to the department.

### How many students am I looking to admit for Fall 23?

Ideally one or two.

### Can I contact you w/ questions?

Yes, you may contact me via the email address on my [personal homepage](https://chrisdonahue.com), though I may not be able to respond to all inquiries. Yonatan Bisk has a [page](https://yonatanbisk.com/emailing_professors.html) w/ general wisdom about emailing faculty and the graduate admissions process.

If you have a general question about the application process, you can also [open an issue on this GitHub page](https://github.com/chrisdonahue/fall23-phd-prospectives/issues), which will have a higher likelihood of a response.
